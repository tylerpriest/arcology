# Audience & Jobs to Be Done - Cyberpunk Venus Arcology

## Audience Personas

- **Arcology Architect** (Builder/Manager): Wants to build a functioning self-sustaining vertical city on Venus
- **Systems Operator** (Simulation Enthusiast): Wants to manage complex interdependent systems and maintain infrastructure
- **Resident Observer** (Sandbox Player): Wants to watch residents interact in a living world and make meaningful decisions

## Jobs to Be Done

### Arcology Architect (God-like planner building a self-sustaining city)

#### JTBD 1: I want to place buildings and rooms strategically so my vision for a Venus settlement comes to life
- **Context**: Starting with $20,000 and empty floors, player is making long-term infrastructure decisions
- **Tension**: Early choices lock in future possibilities (placement is permanent without expensive demolition)
- **Victory condition**: Functional arcology where residents are housed, fed, and employed
- **Related to**: Budget constraints, room types, strategic layering of zones
- **Black & White influence**: You're a god-architect making civilization-scale decisions

#### JTBD 2: I want to extend my lobby when it becomes crowded so I can manage traffic flow and growth
- **Context**: Residents spend time walking through lobbies to reach elevators/stairs; narrow lobbies create bottlenecks
- **Tension**: Lobby extension costs money (mid-game investment) but solves congestion without rebuilding
- **Victory condition**: Smooth resident flow, reduced complaints about "crowded halls", residents arriving on time to work
- **Related to**: Resident satisfaction, movement speed, economic trade-offs
- **SimTower influence**: Managing vertical traffic is core to city viability, not just aesthetic
- **Liminal space influence**: Watching residents navigate eerie, efficient corridors is part of the appeal

#### JTBD 3: I want to plan long-term expansion so I can build sustainably without running out of money
- **Context**: Can't build if you don't have money (hard constraint); income from rent must exceed costs
- **Tension**: Building more apartments generates income but requires upfront cost; expansion is risky
- **Victory condition**: Steady cash flow that allows planned growth without bankruptcy crisis every other month
- **Related to**: Economic simulation, cost management, income generation, risk management
- **Jones in the Fast Lane influence**: Real economic pressure; every decision has financial consequences

#### JTBD 4: I want to manage a larger map with more space to build in all directions so I have room to scale my vision
- **Context**: 40-unit-wide building limits vision; want 100+ unit width to create distinct districts, sprawl, redundancy
- **Tension**: Larger map creates more complexity but enables emergent zoning (corporate sector, residential, industrial)
- **Victory condition**: Massive, sprawling arcology that feels like a real city with distinct neighborhoods
- **Related to**: Long-term play, vision expression, emergence
- **Cyberpunk influence**: Massive megacities with corporate zones, slums, luxury districts, industrial sprawl

#### JTBD 5: I want residents to walk between locations (not float) so the building feels physically real
- **Context**: Movement is visible, takes time, creates natural bottlenecks and traffic patterns
- **Tension**: Walking creates emergent problems (lobby congestion) that force meaningful player decisions (expand lobby)
- **Victory condition**: Satisfying to watch residents navigate corridors; feel of a living, breathing city
- **Related to**: Pathfinding, congestion, lobby extension, movement time
- **Liminal space + realism**: Empty halls with residents walking through them is aesthetically compelling and immersive

### Systems Operator (Deep simulation enthusiast managing infrastructure)

#### JTBD 6: I want to maintain oxygen scrubbers and other critical systems so my arcology doesn't collapse
- **Context**: Venus atmosphere is hostile; arcology is a closed system that requires constant maintenance
- **Tension**: Systems degrade over time, failures cascade, players must prioritize maintenance budget
- **Victory condition**: Systems operational, residents safe, no catastrophic failures
- **Related to**: Maintenance system, degradation mechanics, resource allocation, emergency response
- **Cyberpunk + SimTower influence**: High-tech systems hidden behind walls, infrastructure is as important as residents

#### JTBD 7: I want systems to fail realistically when unmaintained so maintenance feels critical and impactful
- **Context**: Ignoring oxygen scrubber maintenance for 30 days leads to failure; ignoring power systems causes cascades
- **Tension**: Can't maintain everything simultaneously with limited budget; must choose what to let degrade
- **Victory condition**: Feeling like you're managing a real system where neglect has serious consequences
- **Related to**: Failure states, resident survival, economic pressure, strategic prioritization
- **Black & White influence**: Consequences of neglect are real and dramatic, not just abstract numbers

#### JTBD 8: I want deep sub-systems (500+ agents) working on all aspects of city life so the simulation feels alive
- **Context**: Instead of abstract "food production", see maintenance workers, oxygen processors, power generators, cleaners all as agents
- **Tension**: More agents = more emergent behavior but harder to track; creates surprise and stories
- **Victory condition**: Watching sub-systems interact, noticing cascading failures, seeing emergent patterns
- **Related to**: Agent-based simulation, system interactions, emergence, surprises
- **Jones in the Fast Lane + Black & White influence**: Feeling like you're observing a world, not directing a spreadsheet

#### JTBD 9: I want emergent gameplay from system interactions so each city tells a unique story
- **Context**: Oxygen failure cascades to power failure cascades to elevator failure cascades to resident panic
- **Tension**: Can't predict all outcomes; players discover through playing, get surprised
- **Victory condition**: No two playthroughs feel the same; unique stories emerge (e.g., "the great blackout of year 3")
- **Related to**: Agent interactions, failure cascades, randomness, storytelling
- **Cyberpunk + Black & White influence**: Your choices and the world's reactions create a narrative

#### JTBD 10: I want to see residents walk through corridors and navigate bottlenecks (not teleport) so pathfinding feels real
- **Context**: Residents have schedules; movement time affects whether they arrive on time; congestion creates drama
- **Tension**: Observing residents creates emotional investment; you care about solving their problems
- **Victory condition**: Smooth traffic flow, residents arriving on time, visual satisfaction of efficient corridors
- **Related to**: Movement system, congestion, lobby extension, resident satisfaction
- **Liminal space influence**: Beauty in watching residents navigate efficient infrastructure; eerie empty halls are part of appeal

### Resident Observer (Story-driven player investing in individual narratives)

#### JTBD 11: I want to understand each resident's story (traits, job, salary, family) so I care about their survival
- **Context**: Residents have names, traits, ambitions; player can read their stories through trait descriptions and behavior
- **Tension**: Can't save everyone; some will be unemployed or underfed if you make wrong building decisions
- **Victory condition**: Feeling emotionally invested in individual residents' fates; mourning when someone starves
- **Related to**: Resident generation, traits, stories, unemployment mechanics, starvation mechanics
- **Black & White + SimTower influence**: Seeing how your decisions affect individuals, not just aggregate numbers

#### JTBD 12: I want to watch residents succeed or fail based on the systems I build so my choices have visible consequences
- **Context**: Build office → residents get jobs → earn money → buy meals → thrive. Don't build office → residents starve.
- **Tension**: Seeing consequences forces moral engagement ("should I demolish poor district to build luxury towers?")
- **Victory condition**: Feeling the weight of planning decisions; understanding that every room placement affects someone
- **Related to**: Economic systems, employment, food production, satisfaction tracking
- **Black & White + Cyberpunk influence**: God-like power comes with moral consequences

#### JTBD 13: I want to respond to crises (oxygen failure, power loss, unemployment spikes) so I feel like I'm managing a real emergency
- **Context**: Systems fail suddenly; residents panic; player must diagnose and fix problem under time pressure
- **Tension**: Creates moments of intense engagement and problem-solving
- **Victory condition**: Successfully stabilizing a crisis feels heroic; preventing crises through good planning feels smart
- **Related to**: Failure mechanics, diagnostics, emergency response, maintenance, prioritization
- **Cyberpunk + Black & White influence**: Real consequences create real drama

## Cross-JTBD Dependencies

### Core Loops

**Loop 1: The Economic Cycle** (JTBD 1, 3, 6)
- Player places apartments (JTBD 1) → residents generate rent income (JTBD 3) → income covers maintenance (JTBD 6)
- If apartments insufficient, rent too low to maintain systems → systems fail (JTBD 7) → residents unhappy/leave
- If apartments too many, can't afford maintenance → oxygen failure (JTBD 6) → residents die → game over

**Loop 2: The Traffic Problem** (JTBD 2, 5, 10)
- Residents walk through lobbies (JTBD 5, 10) → congestion emerges as more residents arrive (JTBD 2 context)
- Congestion delays residents → late to work → reduced productivity/income
- Player extends lobby (JTBD 2) → residents move faster → arrive on time → productivity restored
- Then expands building further → congestion returns → cycle repeats at larger scale

**Loop 3: The Maintenance Crisis** (JTBD 6, 7, 8, 9)
- Systems run normally (well-maintained) → players inattentive → ignore maintenance schedule
- Oxygen scrubber skipped for 30 days → scrubber degrades → air quality drops (first failure)
- Players notice residents complaining → scramble to fix oxygen (reactive, costly)
- But while fixing oxygen, power system was ignored → power fails → elevators stop → residents trapped
- Cascading failures create drama and stories (JTBD 9) → players learn to be proactive

**Loop 4: Resident Stories** (JTBD 11, 12, 13)
- New resident spawns with traits, ambitions, salary expectations (JTBD 11)
- Player's building configuration determines if they succeed: need job, food, safe environment (JTBD 12)
- Crisis forces choice: save this resident or save the whole arcology (JTBD 13)
- Resident's fate becomes part of player's narrative

### System Interactions

**Maintenance System ↔ Economic System**:
- High maintenance costs reduce profit margin → limits expansion (JTBD 3)
- Poor maintenance creates crises → emergency expenses spike → can trigger bankruptcy

**Resident Movement ↔ Maintenance**:
- Elevator failures (maintenance) strand residents → congestion in stairs instead
- Stairwell overcrowding (from failed elevators) creates dramatic visual problem
- Player chooses: extend stairs (expensive) vs. fix elevators (cheaper)?

**Resident Stories ↔ System Failures**:
- Named resident starves when food system collapses (JTBD 11, 12)
- Player recognizes them from trait descriptions → emotional impact
- Creates moral weight to maintenance decisions

**Map Size ↔ Emergent Complexity** (JTBD 4, 8, 9):
- Larger map allows more complex districts
- More districts = more potential failure cascades
- More agents working means more surprise interactions
- 500+ agents create genuine emergence that's hard to predict

## Aesthetic & Thematic Influences

- **Cyberpunk 2077**: Neon, retro-futurism, corporate arcologies, economic stratification
- **SimTower**: Vertical city management, resident satisfaction, economic balance
- **Black & White**: God-like perspective, consequence-driven gameplay, moral choices
- **Jones in the Fast Lane**: Economic competition, real-time pressures, strategic planning
- **Liminal spaces**: Eerie beauty of empty corridors, utility infrastructure, 80s/90s aesthetic

## Gameplay Philosophy

### Physical Reality Over Abstraction
- **Residents walk, not float**. Movement is visible, takes time, creates natural bottlenecks.
- **Congestion is a real problem** that emerges from player's building decisions.
- **Infrastructure matters**: Stairs, elevators, corridors are not background—they're critical systems.
- **Lobby extension is spatial problem-solving**: Make corridors wider, reduce congestion, smooth traffic flow.

### Economic Realism Over Abstraction
- **Can't build without money** (hard constraint). Players must plan multi-year financial strategies.
- **Early decisions lock in future possibilities**: Room placement is permanent without expensive demolition.
- **Economic cycles create tension**: Build apartments to generate income, but this increases congestion and maintenance needs.
- **Maintenance competes with expansion for budget**: Can't do both at once—strategic trade-offs required.

### Maintenance as Core Gameplay (Not Tedious Busywork)
- **Systems fail in dramatic, cascading ways**: Oxygen → power → elevators → residents trapped.
- **Maintenance creates stories**: "The Year We Lost the East Wing" narratives emerge from player choices.
- **Preventative vs. reactive gameplay**: Ignoring maintenance is tempting (more money for expansion) but risky.
- **Oxygen scrubbers, power systems, food chains** are not UI elements—they're systems with agents working on them.

### Deep Simulation Enabling Emergence
- **500+ agents** (maintenance workers, processors, residents, cleaners) create genuine surprise.
- **No scripted events**: Crises emerge from system interactions, not developer templates.
- **Players are observing a world**, not directing a spreadsheet of abstract metrics.
- **Each playthrough generates unique stories** because the simulation is deep enough for genuine emergence.

### Scale & Scope Enabling Vision
- **Larger map (100+ units wide)** allows multiple, distinct districts: corporate sector, slums, industrial zone, luxury towers.
- **Longer play sessions** (years of in-game time) allow players to build vast, sprawling cities.
- **Lifespan of arcology spans generations**: Residents are born, work, retire, die. Player's initial construction lasts decades.
- **Megacity feel**: Not a small community but a massive, complex civilization on Venus.

## Thematic Resonance

### Liminal Space Aesthetics
- **Beauty in efficiency**: Corridors are clean, geometric, almost eerie. Watching residents navigate them is hypnotic.
- **Uncanny emptiness**: Entire floors can be empty during off-hours. This creates tension and atmosphere.
- **Neon against darkness**: Venus's alien landscape outside contrasts with arcology's industrial interior.
- **80s/90s retro-futurism**: Aesthetic of abandoned corporate facilities, utility infrastructure, service areas.

### God Complex (Black & White Influence)
- **God-like perspective**: Top-down view of entire arcology; you are the architect and god of this world.
- **Moral weight**: Every decision affects named individuals. You can't save everyone.
- **Indirect control**: You can't force residents to work or eat—they respond to systems you build.
- **Consequences are inescapable**: Ignoring a problem doesn't make it go away; it compounds.

### Cyberpunk Aesthetic
- **Neon-lit, high-tech, corporate arcology**: Massive self-contained structure with distinct class zones.
- **Economic stratification**: Luxury penthouses above maintenance worker quarters above slums.
- **Systems oppressing individuals**: Residents are subject to the economics of arcology survival.
- **Beauty in decay**: Maintained systems are aesthetic; decaying systems are visually alarming.

### SimTower Mechanics Reimagined
- **Vertical city management**: But residents actually walk between locations.
- **Economic balance**: Can't ignore income/expense ratio.
- **Resident satisfaction**: Matters because it affects morale, productivity, retention.
- **Long-term play**: Building that feels satisfying to manage over months of gameplay.

## Emotional Beats

### Early Game (First Year)
- **Wonder**: "I'm building a city on Venus!"
- **Urgency**: Limited money, need to generate income quickly.
- **Learning**: Understanding which systems feed into which other systems.

### Mid Game (Year 2-5)
- **Confidence**: "I've got this city under control."
- **Overextension**: Expanding too fast without proper maintenance infrastructure.
- **First crisis**: Oxygen scrubber failure. Panic. Recovery feels heroic.

### Late Game (Year 5+)
- **Mastery**: Understanding cascading systems, planning preventatively.
- **Investment**: Recognizing specific residents by name and traits, caring about their fates.
- **Narratives**: "My arcology survived the Great Blackout of Year 7"

### Failure States
- **Oxygen depletion**: Residents suffocate. Game over. Brutal.
- **Power failure cascade**: Multiple critical systems down simultaneously. Chaos.
- **Economic collapse**: Can't afford maintenance. Slow death spiral.
- **Overcrowding death**: Lobby congestion causes stampedes. Residents die in panic.

These failures aren't instant—they're telegraphed, giving players chance to respond and creating tension.
