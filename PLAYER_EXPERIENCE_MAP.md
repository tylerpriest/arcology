# Player Experience Map - What Playing Arcology Feels Like

## Hour 1: Wonder & Learning

### What the player does:
- Starts with $20,000 and empty 40-unit lobby
- Clicks to place first apartment
- Sees residents spawn and move into building
- Places office building
- Watches residents walk to offices

### What they experience:
- **Wonder**: "I'm building a city on Venus!"
- **Fascination**: Watching residents navigate corridors
- **Learning**: Understanding room placement, income generation
- **Agency**: Every click directly affects the world

### What they're actually learning about:
- Building placement mechanics
- Resident spawning and pathfinding
- Economic basics (apartment = income)

### Failure mode:
- Runs out of money before food system produces meals
- Residents starve
- Game over (but teaches lesson: need food AND housing)

---

## Hour 2-4: Momentum & Discovery

### What the player does:
- Building apartments → offices → farms → kitchens
- Watching residents move between rooms
- Noticing lobby is crowded as building gets taller
- Seeing income generated from rents
- Planning next expansion

### What they experience:
- **Confidence**: "I've got this figured out"
- **Engagement**: Watching the system work is satisfying
- **Foresight**: Thinking about what rooms to build next
- **Optimization**: Trying to arrange rooms efficiently

### What they're actually learning about:
- Production chains (farm → kitchen → food)
- Traffic patterns (residents taking time to move)
- Economic growth (more apartments = more income)

### Interesting observation:
- Lobby is getting crowded
- Residents seem to be taking longer to reach elevators
- Some residents arriving late to work

---

## Hour 5-8: The First Crisis

### What triggers it:
Player has been focused on expansion, ignoring maintenance UI alerts about oxygen scrubber.

### What happens:
- Oxygen scrubber has been running for 60 days without maintenance
- Degradation threshold hit: scrubber breaks
- Oxygen levels start dropping
- Residents start complaining
- UI alerts light up red: "CRITICAL: Oxygen System Failure"

### What the player does:
- Panics (this is real)
- Clicks "Repair Oxygen Scrubber"
- System costs $5,000 emergency repair (2x normal cost)
- Scrubber comes online
- Oxygen levels stabilize
- Residents stop complaining

### What they experience:
- **Urgency**: Time pressure (oxygen dropping, can't wait)
- **Stakes**: Real consequences (residents suffer/die if delayed)
- **Heroism**: Fixing the crisis feels like saving the city
- **Regret**: "I should have done preventative maintenance"

### What they learned:
- Maintenance is not optional
- Ignoring systems has real consequences
- Money spent on maintenance is investment, not waste

---

## Hour 8-12: The Maintenance Balancing Act

### The new equilibrium:
Player now tracks maintenance schedules. Balances:
- Maintenance budget (keeps systems running)
- Expansion budget (builds new rooms for income)

### What happens:
They're allocating $2,000/month to maintenance and $3,000/month to expansion.

Life goes well for a while...

Then something interesting happens:

### Power system gets neglected:
While focused on oxygen (they learned that lesson), power system is ignored for 40 days.

Power system starts degrading.

**But**: Player doesn't notice immediately because power system doesn't fail all at once—it degrades.

Power generation drops to 80% → 60% → 40%.

Elevators start moving slower (less power available).

Residents experience 5-second delays between floors.

### Cascading failure:
Players don't notice until **elevators start getting stuck**.

Residents report being trapped in elevators.

Emergency lights come on (visual signal).

Players finally look at power system: "Oh no, I've been ignoring this for weeks!"

Now they face a choice:
- Emergency repair power ($10,000 cost, breaks other budgets)
- Accept slow elevators while fixing gradually ($1,000/month)
- Spread maintenance across systems (everything degrades faster)

### What they experience:
- **Complexity**: Managing multiple systems is harder than they thought
- **Trade-offs**: Every choice affects something else
- **Realism**: This feels like real infrastructure management
- **Drama**: Cascading failures feel consequential, not arbitrary

---

## Hour 12-20: The Traffic Crisis

### Building is now tall (15 floors):

200 residents living/working in building.

Morning rush: Everyone trying to use elevator from lobby at same time.

Result: **Visible congestion in lobby**

Residents bunch up, slow down, take 10 seconds to reach elevator (vs. 2 seconds normally).

Residents arrive late to work.

Income drops (productivity down).

### What the player observes:
Watching the lobby, it's obvious: too many people, not enough space.

### The realization:
"I can extend the lobby!"

They've seen this option, but never had reason to use it before.

Cost: $3,000 to extend lobby 5 units wider.

### They extend the lobby.

Result: Immediate visual change.

Residents spread out.

Congestion gone.

Residents arrive on time.

Income restored.

### What they experience:
- **Spatial problem-solving**: Using building layout to solve traffic problem
- **Cause and effect**: Direct relationship between lobby width and flow
- **Efficiency**: Watching smooth traffic is satisfying
- **Achievement**: Solving a problem they observe

### The pattern they notice:
Every time they expand the building, eventually congestion returns.

They'll need to extend lobby again at higher floors.

This cycle repeats.

---

## Hour 20-40: The Stratification & Moral Questions

### Building is now massive (20+ floors, 150+ units wide in expanded vision):

They've built:
- **East side**: Corporate offices, fancy restaurants, luxury apartments
- **Central**: Medium apartments, ordinary services
- **West side**: Food production, power generation, oxygen systems
- **Bottom**: Cheap housing, unemployment (couldn't afford better)

### Natural observation:
Wealthy residents live in nice east side.
Poor residents live in cramped bottom floors.
Workers toil in west side maintenance zones.

### The moral question arises naturally:
"Should I demolish the cheap housing and build luxury towers for more income?"

Game doesn't say this is wrong.

But player **feels** the weight:
- Those are named residents
- They recognize traits of people living there
- Demolishing means those residents are unemployed/homeless

### Different players make different choices:
- Some maximize efficiency (demolish slums, build corporate)
- Some maintain mixed community (keeps cheap housing)
- Some go full stratification (clearly separated classes)

Game doesn't judge. But **consequences unfold based on choice**:

**If demolish cheap housing**:
- Unemployment spikes
- Crime/unrest emerges (represented by reduced morale)
- Maintenance workers harder to hire (no one lives nearby)
- Building feels cold, sterile

**If keep mixed**:
- More diverse resident base
- Better maintenance worker availability
- Community feel (more narrative variety)
- Less income per square foot

### What they experience:
- **Moral agency**: Their choices create a society
- **Narrative emergence**: Consequences unfold over time
- **Realism**: City reflects their values
- **Stakes**: These are real people, real fates

---

## Hour 40-60: Mastery & Unique Story

### They've now played long enough (in-game: years 3-5) to:
- Understand cascading failures
- Predict when systems will degrade
- Plan expansions accounting for maintenance
- Know residents by name and traits

### They're thinking like an urban planner:
"If I place offices here, residents walk through congested lobby, so I need to extend lobby there, which costs money, so I need more apartments there, but that increases oxygen load, so I need backup oxygen system..."

### Their arcology is unique:
Based on their choices, their city looks nothing like someone else's.

If they focused on expansion: sprawling, chaotic, poorly maintained
If they focused on maintenance: clean, efficient, slow growth
If they focused on stratification: visibly divided classes
If they focused on mixed community: diverse, vibrant, balanced

### Critical moment:
Year 5: A multi-system failure happens.

Oxygen fails → triggers power emergency → power system fails → elevators fail → residents panicked in stairwells → food doesn't reach upper floors

This cascading failure would be catastrophic... **except** they planned ahead.

They built backup oxygen system.
They built redundant power distribution.
They maintain stockpiled food.

The crisis resolves because of their planning.

**They feel like heroes** because they saw this coming and prevented it.

### What they experience:
- **Mastery**: Understanding complex systems
- **Narrative**: "My city survived Year 5 Cascading Failure"
- **Pride**: Their planning prevented disaster
- **Meaning**: Every decision mattered

---

## Failure State: Economic Collapse

### Different path (if player mismanages):

They built apartments too slowly.
Maintenance costs kept rising.
Income never caught up.
By year 3, monthly expenses > monthly income.

They go into debt.

Try to recover by:
- Skipping maintenance (save money now)
- Building more apartments (income later)

But skipping maintenance triggers failures immediately.
Emergencies cost 2x normal.
Debt spirals.

By year 4, they can't even afford emergency repairs.
Systems start failing permanently.
Residents leave in waves.
Building becomes uninhabitable.

Game over: Economic collapse.

### What they experienced:
- **Tension**: Watching debt accumulate is stressful
- **Consequences**: Bad early decisions compound
- **Learning**: Financial planning really matters
- **Stakes**: Real threat of failure

---

## Failure State: Resident Catastrophe

### Another failure path:

They prioritized luxury expansion.
Ignored food production.
Kitchen broke down (skipped maintenance).
No one noticed (too busy building).

Suddenly: Residents starving.

Game shows named residents dying.
"Marcus the chef starved in the stairwell"
"Yuki the engineer died of hunger"

Player recognizes these names from the UI panels they read.

Game over: Mass starvation.

### What they experienced:
- **Horror**: Death is real and personal (not abstract)
- **Consequences**: Ignoring food systems kills people
- **Emotional impact**: Recognizing names of dead residents
- **Learning**: Every system is critical

---

## Long-term Play (100+ hours)

Players who reach this point:

- Have built 40+ story mega-arcologies
- Recognize patterns (congestion cycles, maintenance beats, economic rhythms)
- Experiment with strategies (all corporate? all mixed? extreme stratification?)
- Generate narratives ("My arcology where oxygen failed three times and recovered each time")
- Replay to try different approaches

### Emergent stories they tell:
"Year 12: The West Side Collapse" - Industrial zone failed, took 2 years to rebuild
"The Year of Plenty" - Everything worked perfectly, rare occurrence
"The Eternal Shortage" - Always on edge of bankruptcy, thrilling
"The Perfect City" - Balanced, diverse, sustainable growth

## Key Design Principles in Action

### Physical Realism Creates Emergence
Walking → congestion → naturally teaches player about infrastructure

### Economic Realism Creates Tension
Scarcity → meaningful trade-offs → every decision matters

### Maintenance as Gameplay Creates Drama
Degradation → cascading failures → stressful moments → heroic recoveries

### 500+ Agents Create Surprise
Residents have traits/ambitions → feel like people → player cares what happens to them
Maintenance workers exist → failures feel like real infrastructure problems

### Moral Complexity Creates Stories
No "right answer" → players express values through building → cities reflect choices
Consequences unfold naturally → player learns impact of their decisions

---

## What Makes This Different

**vs. SimTower**: Residents actually walk, creating real congestion. Maintenance actually matters.

**vs. Regular Strategy Game**: Residents are individuals with names/traits, not abstract metrics. Failures cascade, not just "lose money."

**vs. Cyberpunk Game**: You're god-like architect watching your world unfold, not protagonist in scripted story.

vs. **Most Management Sims**: Every failure state is emergent, not scripted. Every success is your specific strategy, not following guide.
