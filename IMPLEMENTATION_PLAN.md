# Implementation Plan - Arcology MVP

> Prioritized task list for Arcology MVP. Updated after spec review and test analysis.

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-18 - After reviewing comprehensive vision documents (VISION.md, VISION_DEEP_DIVE.md, JTBD_TO_SPECS_MAPPING.md, SPEC_PHASE_DOCUMENTS.md). Vision reveals that MVP is foundation for post-MVP agent-based simulation. Plan: (1) Fix tests, (2) Complete MVP core loops, (3) Prepare architecture for 500+ agents in Phase 2.

## Executive Summary

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **Phase 0 (Critical Features): COMPLETE** - Sky lobbies, height limits, tenant types, lunch behavior
- ✅ **Phase 1 (Audio System): COMPLETE** - AudioSystem with all sound effects and settings integration
- ✅ **Phase 2 (Resident Visual Variety): COMPLETE** - Color palettes, size variation, traits system
- ✅ **Phase 3 (Spec Compliance): COMPLETE** - Restaurant visual state, UI component tests
- ✅ **Phase 4a (Core Economy): COMPLETE** - Star rating system, bankruptcy detection, rent tiers, satisfaction formula
- ✅ **Phase 4b (Food System): COMPLETE** - Restaurant evaluation, food consumption, operating hours

**TEST VALIDATION:** Test failures exist (54 tests failing) but all core gameplay features are functionally complete and integrated.
- GameScene.test.ts: 17 failures - glowGraphics.setBlendMode() mock missing
- ResourceSystem.test.ts: 5 failures - production rate expectations mismatch  
- EconomySystem.test.ts: 9 failures - mock scene.graphics property missing
- ResidentSystem.test.ts: 2 failures - mock resourceSystem.addFood() missing
- Sidebar.test.ts: 1 failure - click handler callback issue

## New Vision Documents & What They Mean for MVP

Five comprehensive vision documents were created that fundamentally reshape post-MVP scope:

### VISION.md
- One-sentence pitch: Cyberpunk Venus arcology where residents walk (not float), maintenance is gameplay, cascading failures create unique stories
- 5 core design pillars: Physical realism, economic realism, maintenance as gameplay, 500+ agents, scale & scope
- 4 core loops: Economic cycle, traffic problem, maintenance crisis, resident stories
- Thematic anchor: Liminal spaces + cyberpunk aesthetic

**MVP Impact**: MVP establishes foundation for all 5 pillars. The pathfinding system (residents walk) is already in place. Economics loop already exists. Now needs stress/satisfaction to complete.

### VISION_DEEP_DIVE.md
- Core insight: **Constraints create emergence** (scarcity of money, time, maintenance budget)
- Why movement matters: Natural congestion emerges from residents walking (lobby extension becomes necessary gameplay)
- Why maintenance matters: Cascading failures create drama (oxygen → power → elevators)
- Why 500+ agents matter: Visibility of infrastructure workers makes failures feel real
- Why map size matters: Enables district stratification, diverse emergent stories

**MVP Impact**: MVP must establish the tension from constraints. Economic loop creates natural scarcity. Movement system creates natural congestion. Satisfaction system creates natural tension about choices.

### JTBD_TO_SPECS_MAPPING.md
- Maps 13 JTBDs → 30+ specifications needed
- Prioritizes by phase:
  - Phase 1: Resident Movement & Congestion (JTBD 2, 5, 10)
  - Phase 2: Maintenance & Cascading Failures (JTBD 6, 7, 9)
  - Phase 3: 500+ Agents & Emergence (JTBD 8, 9)
  - Phase 4: Economy & Large Map (JTBD 1, 3, 4)
  - Phase 5: Resident Stories & Crisis (JTBD 11, 12, 13)

**MVP Impact**: MVP focuses on Phases 1-2 foundation. Phase 1 (Movement/Congestion) partially done—needs animations + congestion feedback. Phase 2 (Maintenance) is POST-MVP. MVP can prepare architecture for Phase 3+ (agents).

### Key Realization
The vision documents reveal that **MVP is not the complete game, but the foundation for a much larger vision**. MVP's job is to:
1. Establish the core loops work (economic, traffic, resident stories, food/time)
2. Create tension through constraints (money scarcity, maintenance needs)
3. Show that the core mechanic (residents walk) creates emergent gameplay
4. Build architecture that scales to 500+ agents in Phase 2+

This reframes what "MVP done" means: not "feature complete game," but "proof of concept that the vision works."

## Key Insights from JTBD Analysis

The JTBD reveals that **MVP must support these core loops:**

1. **Economic Loop** (JTBD 1, 3, 6): Build apartments → Earn rent → Maintain systems → Reinvest
   - Blocking: Satisfaction formula + rent tiers + bankruptcy detection
   - Victory: Reach 300 population (2 stars) = sustainable income

2. **Traffic Loop** (JTBD 2, 5, 10): More residents → Lobby congestion → Player extends lobby → Repeat
   - Partially done: Pathfinding implemented, needs animations + congestion feedback
   - Post-MVP: Lobby extension feature

3. **Resident Stories Loop** (JTBD 11, 12, 13): Residents with traits → Succeed/fail → Player cares
   - Blocking: Satisfaction system showing visible consequences to player choices
   - MVP: Display how building decisions affect individual residents

4. **Food & Time Loop** (JTBD 5, 12): Hunger → Eating → Working → Earning → Thriving
   - Blocking: Restaurant system + time progression + food availability feedback
   - Partially done: Food production chain exists, needs restaurant hours + evaluation

**JTBD-Driven MVP Definition:**
- Reach 300 population sustainably (economic loop working)
- Residents walk, eat, work, sleep (time loop functional)
- Player sees moral consequences of their building choices (resident stories visible)
- Satisfaction system creates tension (not all residents can be satisfied)

**Post-MVP (JTBD 6-9):**
- Maintenance system with cascading failures
- 500+ agent simulation for emergent gameplay
- Systems Operator loop (maintain vs. expand trade-offs)

## Phase 5 - Post-MVP Features (Spec-Driven)

Two major new specs added:
- **RESIDENT_MOVEMENT.md** - Replace teleportation with realistic walking between rooms
- **CONGESTION_MECHANICS.md** - Emergent congestion from multiple residents moving simultaneously

### P1 - Resident Movement System (JTBD 2, 5, 10: Traffic Loop)

## New: Phase 1 Specs - Movement & Traffic System

Three comprehensive Phase 1 specifications have been created forming the "Traffic Loop" (JTBD 2, 5, 10):

### 1. RESIDENT_MOVEMENT.md - Foundation
**What it defines:**
- Residents walk (not teleport) taking time proportional to distance
- Movement includes pathfinding (A*), speed variation by resident type
- Movement time affects schedule adherence (late arrivals matter)
- Variable speeds: office workers faster, children slower
- Elevator/stair queue integration, capacity limits

**Key criteria:**
- Movement time consistent (±0.2 second variance)
- Congestion creates slowdown (20+ residents = 50% speed reduction)
- Pathfinding <50ms even with 500+ agents
- All movement animated, no teleportation
- Integration points: Schedules, Elevators, Congestion system

**6 Scenarios:** Simple commute (7s), rush hour (queue visible), multi-floor (distance compounds), lobby extension (dynamic improvement), elevator failure (fallback), cascading jam (overflow).

### 2. CONGESTION_MECHANICS.md - Problem Emerges
**What it defines:**
- Congestion emerges naturally when residents use same spaces
- Density = residents ÷ space area → congestion %
- Speed penalty function: 0% congestion = 1.0x speed, 100% = 0.2x speed
- Different space capacities: elevator < stairwell < corridor < lobby
- Congestion cycle: 8 AM rush → peak congestion → drops by noon

**Key criteria:**
- Congestion forms without scripting (natural emergence)
- Congestion visible (residents bunching together)
- Impact measurable (>30 second arrival time difference)
- Satisfies affected by congestion (−5 per level)
- Queue behavior: FIFO, respects capacity, overflows wait

**5 Scenarios:** Morning rush (8 residents form congestion), overflow (elevator capacity 4), lobby extension effect (congestion drops 30%), stairwell bottleneck (elevator broken), layout creates natural jam.

**Congestion Scale:** 0-20% (empty), 20-40% (moderate), 40-60% (high), 60-80% (very high), 80-100% (critical), 100%+ (severe).

### 3. LOBBY_EXTENSION.md - Solution Available
**What it defines:**
- Player can extend lobby width in increments (1, 5, 10 units)
- Cost: $100 per unit width added ($500-5000 depending on size)
- Effect: 25% wider lobby = ~25% less congestion
- Max width: 60 units (hard cap from 20-unit start)
- Undo supported: 50% refund like other buildings

**Key criteria:**
- Extension affordable but significant (cost vs. apartment choice)
- Congestion reduction measurable (30% width increase → ~30% congestion drop)
- Effect immediate (residents experience reduced congestion next movement)
- Player understands purpose (diagnose & solve)
- Extension is visible change (wider lobby on screen)
- Strategic choice (sometimes worth it, sometimes not)

**5 Scenarios:** First congestion problem (extends to solve), strategic before crisis (prevents problem), cascading extensions (late game limits), extension doesn't solve everything (diagnose bottleneck), economic pressure (choose between priorities).

---

### How They Create The Traffic Loop (JTBD 2):
1. **Residents walk** (RESIDENT_MOVEMENT) → Takes time, affects schedules
2. **Multiple residents same corridor** (CONGESTION_MECHANICS) → Density increases → Movement slows
3. **Player sees congestion** → Residents bunching, arriving late
4. **Player extends lobby** (LOBBY_EXTENSION) → Wider space → Congestion drops → Residents arrive on time
5. **Building gets bigger** → More residents → Congestion returns at larger scale
6. **Loop repeats** → Cycle creates natural expansion mechanic

This is **emergence without scripting**: No developer event saying "you must extend lobby," but the mechanical system creates the need naturally.

**MVP Impact**: These three specs complete Phase 1. Together they explain why congestion matters and how player solves it. This is JTBD 2 fully specified. Without these specs, lobby extension would be arbitrary feature. With them, it's natural consequence of physical movement.
