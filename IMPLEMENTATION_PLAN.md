## Architecture Notes

**Patterns Used:**
- Phaser Registry for cross-scene state sharing (GameScene ↔ UIScene)
- Systems pattern: TimeSystem, EconomySystem, ResidentSystem, ResourceSystem, RestaurantSystem, ElevatorSystem, SaveSystem
- Entity hierarchy: Building → Floor → Room, Residents reference Rooms
- Vitest with canvas mocks for Phaser testing
- HTML/CSS UI overlay (UIManager) separate from Phaser scenes

**Known Technical Debt:**
- GAME_SPEED constant exists but TimeSystem.speed is mutable (minor inconsistency)
- ✅ Sky lobby system implemented (Phase 0 completed - pathfinding with zone transfers working)
- ✅ Building height limit enforced (Phase 0 completed - MAX_FLOORS_MVP constant and validation in Building.addRoom())
- ✅ Tenant type differentiation implemented (Phase 0 completed - Resident class has `type` field, office workers spawn/leave on schedule)
- ✅ Office worker lunch behavior implemented (Phase 0 completed - office workers seek Fast Food at 12 PM, consume food, return to office)
- Audio system completely missing (Phase 1 priority - no AudioSystem class, no sound files, no audio asset loading)
- Resident visual variety missing (Phase 2 - no color palette or size variation system, all residents look identical except hunger color)
- Restaurant open/closed visual state not displayed (RestaurantSystem tracks `isOpen` via `isRestaurantOpen()` but Room.ts rendering does not visually indicate state - Phase 3)
- LLM review system placeholder (src/lib/llm-review.ts has TODO for actual LLM integration - Phase 3)
- Skipped tests in llm-review.test.ts (5 visual/subjective tests skipped - waiting for LLM review implementation)

## Dependency Graph

```
Phase 0 (Critical Missing Features)
├── Sky Lobby System ──→ Elevator Zones ──→ Pathfinding Updates
├── Building Height Limit (independent)
├── Tenant Type System ──→ Office Worker Behavior
└── ✅ Office Worker Lunch Behavior (depends on Tenant Type System) - COMPLETED
         │
         ↓
Phase 1 (Audio System) - Independent
         │
         ↓
Phase 2 (Resident Polish) - Independent
         │
         ↓
Phase 3 (Spec Compliance & Testing)
```

**Parallel Work Possible:**
- Phase 0 tasks can be worked on in parallel (sky lobbies, height limit, tenant types)
- Phase 1 (Audio) is fully independent
- Phase 2 (Resident Polish) is fully independent
- Phase 3 (Testing) depends on Phase 0 completion

## MVP Goals Status

**TypeScript/Linting:** ✅ **PASSING** (verified in latest planning session)
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- No linting errors detected
- LLM review system has placeholder TODO (non-blocking)

**Test Coverage Gaps:**
- ❌ ResidentSystem - No tests (HIGH priority)
- ❌ ResourceSystem - No tests (HIGH priority)
- ❌ Building/Room/Resident entities - No tests (MEDIUM priority)
- ❌ All UI components - No tests (MEDIUM priority)
- ❌ All Scenes - No tests (MEDIUM priority)
- ❌ Visual/UI acceptance criteria - No browser/screenshot tests (HIGH priority per PROMPT_build.md)

## Next Actions

**Immediate Priority (High Value):**
1. **Phase 1 - Audio System** (HIGHEST PRIORITY - All Phase 0 features completed ✅)
   - Create AudioSystem class in `src/systems/AudioSystem.ts` with Phaser Sound integration
   - Implement UI sound effects (button clicks, placement success/error, menu open/close)
   - Implement money sounds (income chime, expense tone, large income jingle)
   - Implement alert sounds (low rations, starvation, bankruptcy warning/game over)
   - Implement elevator bell sound (G4 pitch - 392 Hz) on arrival
   - Connect SettingsScene volume sliders to AudioSystem (master, UI, ambient volumes)
   - Load audio assets in BootScene
   - Integrate with EconomySystem (money sounds), Notification system (alerts), ElevatorSystem (bell)
2. **Testing - High Priority:**
   - Add tests for ResidentSystem (core gameplay system - spawning, move-outs, job assignment)
   - Add tests for ResourceSystem (food chain - farm production, kitchen processing, consumption)
   - Add tests for Room/Resident entities (state machine, pathfinding, satisfaction calculation)
3. **Phase 2 - Resident Visual Variety** (Medium Priority):
   - Color palette system based on name hash (4-8 palettes)
   - Size variation (±4px height)
   - Traits system (1-2 traits per resident, display only)
4. **Phase 3 - Spec Compliance** (Medium Priority):
   - Restaurant open/closed visual state (Room.ts needs RestaurantSystem reference)
   - Complete acceptance criteria verification across all specs

**Phase 0 - Critical Missing Features:** ✅ **ALL COMPLETED**
- ✅ Sky lobby system (room type, elevator zones, pathfinding updates)
- ✅ Building height limit enforcement (20 floors MVP)
- ✅ Tenant type system (Office Worker vs Residential Tenant)
- ✅ Office worker lunch behavior (seek Fast Food at 12 PM)

**After Phase 1:**
1. Phase 2 - Resident visual variety (color palettes, size variation, traits)
2. Phase 3 - Spec compliance verification and testing
   - Restaurant open/closed visual state (Room.ts needs RestaurantSystem reference)
   - Complete acceptance criteria verification
   - Add missing test coverage
   - Add visual/browser tests for UI acceptance criteria (per PROMPT_build.md requirement)
